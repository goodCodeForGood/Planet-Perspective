                <p>Climate change is an urgent global crisis that requires universal awareness. The most apparent issue of which is rising greenhouse gases result in unprecedented temperature increases, extreme weather events, and rising sea levels to name a few. Whether we realize it or not, we are contributing to climate change as well through practices like overuse of single-use plastics and even forgetting switch of lights in the house. We are all passionate about spreading awareness of this topic as we believe our actions today directly affect our future.</p>
                
                <h2 className="about--problem">Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>Many people are realizing that global warming is a huge issue, but most people are unaware of how their various actions contribute to the increase in global warming. Many people want to improve the situation but do not know how to get started and are also unaware of many other unusual solutions that can also better the conditions. So, our website provides awareness about the global warming / climate change issue in a heavily-interactive way through hands-on activities and practices that users can use to understand the issue and also actively fight climate change by inculcating our solutions in their life, real time.</p>
                <h2 className="about--stats">Statistics</h2>
                <ul><h3>Global Temperature Rise:</h3>
            
            <li>The Earth's average temperature has risen by about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 19th century.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</h3>
            
            <li>Carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere surpassed 415 parts per million (ppm) in 2021, a level not seen in millions of years.</li>
            <li>The largest sources of global greenhouse gas emissions include the burning of fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, and industrial processes.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Sea Level Rise:</h3>
            
            <li>Global sea levels have risen by about 8 inches (20 cm) over the past century.</li>
            <li>Melting ice caps and glaciers contribute to rising sea levels.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Extreme Weather Events:</h3>
            
            <li>There is an observed increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall events.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Arctic Ice Melt:</h3>
            
            <li>Arctic sea ice extent has been decreasing, with the Arctic warming at more than twice the global average rate.</li></ul>

            <li>The use of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, has been increasing, but fossil fuels still dominate the global energy mix.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>International Agreements:</h3>
            
            <li>The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, with efforts to limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</li></ul>
            
            <p>It's essential to note that ongoing research and monitoring provide more detailed and updated information. Governments, scientists, and organizations around the world continue to work on mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change. For the latest information, refer to reputable sources like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and other climate research institutions</p>
                
               
             <h2>Causes of Climate Change:</h2>
            
            <ul><h3>Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</h3>
            
            <li>The burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) for energy is a major contributor to the increase in greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), in the atmosphere.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Deforestation:</h3>
            
            <li>The clearing of forests for agriculture, logging, and other purposes reduces the number of trees that absorb CO2 from the atmosphere.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Industrial Processes:</h3>
            
            <li>Certain industrial activities release greenhouse gases, such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), into the atmosphere.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Agricultural Practices:</h3>
            
            <li>Agricultural activities, including livestock farming and rice cultivation, produce methane. The use of synthetic fertilizers also releases nitrous oxide.</li></ul>
            <ul><h3>Waste Management:</h3>
            
            <li>Landfills and waste treatment processes can produce methane emissions.</li></ul>
